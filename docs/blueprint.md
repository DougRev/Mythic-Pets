## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Royal Blue (#4169E1), representing the majestic and fantastical themes within the application.
- Background color: Light blue (#D4E2FC), offering a calming and visually unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Purple (#A020F0), used to highlight interactive elements, provide a magical feel and create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font providing elegance with a modern touch, well-suited for the app’s blend of literary and contemporary feel.
- Utilize clear, recognizable icons that thematically align with various fantasy and pet-related actions and themes. Ensure that each icon maintains clarity.
- Implement smooth transitions and loading animations. When new content such as a pet persona or a new part of the AI generated story is created, a relevant animation such as morphing effects should appear.
- Maintain a consistent layout across all pages to provide intuitive user experience. Use a grid-based layout to maintain alignment. Ensure responsive design, meaning the application can adapt to the form factor and resolution of any device that accesses it.
